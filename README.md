# Interpretable-Multi-stage-Attention-DL-Network-to-Predict-Malignancy-in-Cyto-Smears-and-CB-of-PE
In this study, we proposed a deep learning framework, namely Interpretable Multi-stage Attention deep learning Network (IMAN), to predict pleural effusion status using 194 Cytological smears WSIs and 188 cell blocks WSIs from the Biobank of Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei (TSGH).
